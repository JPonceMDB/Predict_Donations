# Predict_Donations
Applying a logistic regression model in order to predict donors behavior (positive or negative).


**Dataset reference**

DSC is an organization that helps non-profit organisations finding donors for their good causes. They have a huge database with candidate donors. DSC wants to launch a new re-activation campaign: they want to send letters to donors that have been inactive for a long time, hoping that they will donate again. They only want to send letters to candidate donors that are likely to donate more than EUR 35. Therefore, they need your help: can you construct a model that predicts which donors are most likely to donate more than EUR 35 for a re-activation campaign?

DSC provides 4 datasets:
- Donors.csv contains general information about the candidate donor database
- Gifts.csv contains information about the gifts that these candidate donors donated in the
past for campaigns that are no re-activation campaigns
- Campaign20130411.csv: donors that were selected for a previous re-activation
campaign on April 11th 2013, and the amount that they gave for this campaign
- Campaign20140115.csv: donors that were selected for a previous re-activation
campaign on January 15th 2014, and the amount that they gave for this campaign.
